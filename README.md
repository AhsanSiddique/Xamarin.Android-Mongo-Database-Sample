MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with querying and indexing of the data.  Collection in MongoDB  A collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is equivalent to an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. The collection does not enforce a schema. Documents within a collection can have different fields. Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.  Document in MongoDB  A document is a set of key-value pairs. Documents have a dynamic schema. Dynamic schema means that the document in the same collection does not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's document may hold different types of data.
